More specifically a meal prep planner. </p>\n<p>When creating a meal prep planner, I wanted it to have the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A place to write the snacks for the day so that I could make sure I was consuming produce that would go bad.</li>\n<li>Be able to create the weekly grocery list as I was creating a meal prep planner to save time. </li>\n<li>Have the planner start on the weekend (Saturday specifically) as that is when I do my meal prep.</li>\n<li>Be easily extensible to include a fortnightly meal prep. This was necessary as I am trying to limit my grocery trips in this time of social isolation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So here goes, you can view my meal plan <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z0HIzC8i90GckV1KPP3rEysUzHgM1veF/view?usp=sharing\">here</a> and make a copy for yourselves by clicking <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KpfGdN0aDWleNdtp7aUbs5hTrD1YDk4oO2FiFJF5AE/copy\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you find it useful, or if you customize it! </p>\n","title":"My meal prep planner","date":"2020-05-16"}},"__N_SSG":true}
