{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"blog_initial_lessons","contentHtml":"<p>This blog is a 1.5 years of planning and inaction, but I am glad that quarantine forced me to get back to working on it. I see it as a way of talking about things that excite me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Books,</li>\n<li>Baking, </li>\n<li>Learning to be half good at many things. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It took a while to get this blog set up, because I first wanted to handcraft the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for each page. I quickly moved away from that to using NextJS and generating AMP Pages*. </p>\n<p>So to kick things off here is a list of a few things I learnt while setting this blog up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>CSS is a blackbox to me. You would think I would have learnt something spending 2 years working on a rendering engine as a Software Engineer. You would be wrong. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross browser and platform testing is tedious. Every change I made needed to be tested on my laptop screen, my desktop monitor and then on my phone (or a mobile simulation). Hats off to people who write tests for every code change they submit. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is a cliche but testing one's own products as a user gives you an empathy like no other. Using AMP as a developer have made me realize issues where either our documentation is lacking or our components could be better. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I don't act on plans unless I am scoping out time for them regularly in my schedule. I had a document detailing what I wanted this blog to be for 1.5 years. Since, I never gave carvedout time for this site, it remained a plan in a document. Now, after working on it for a few hours I am ready to share it with the world. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This blog will evolve as I work on it more, but in the meanwhile enjoy! </p>\n<p>*I work on the <a href=\"amp.dev\">AMP Project</a>.</p>\n","title":"Things I have learnt in creating this blog","date":"2020-05-01"}},"__N_SSG":true}
