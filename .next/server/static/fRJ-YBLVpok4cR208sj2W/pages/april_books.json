I'm in! </p>\n<p>Even if you didn't know that Delia Owens was a biologist her descriptions of the marshes of North Carolina are a giveaway of her expertise. \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" give you an immediate role model in Catherine 'Kya' Clark - a strong girl, having to 'Home Alone' it in a shack. This is currently the best fiction I have read in 2020. </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=m9MoBmPkDA&#x26;rank=1\">Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino</a></strong></p>\n<p>This book consists of essays written by Jia Tolentino - a writer for the New Yorker. My favourite was <code>The Story of a Generation in Seven Scams</code>, a holistic overview at some of the most well known scammers in US contemporary history. I found Jia's reflections on fictional heroines as written in <code>Pure Heroines</code> the most difficult to comprehend - potentially due to not having read much of the literature she quotes. It did give me along reading list to peruse later. It's definitely something I have bookmarked to reread later.  </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21064599-shopaholic-to-the-stars?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=A3zIhmToEu&#x26;rank=1\">Shopaholic to the Stars by Sophie Kinsella</a></strong></p>\n<p>What can I say? Quarantine tricked me into thinking that reading Young adult romantic comedies would be be a good idea. The last time I read about Becky Bloomwood's shopaholic antics I was in my teens. Ten years (ðŸ˜²) later, I can confirm that my empathy doesn't stretch to finding her adventures amusing. </p>\n<p>But ahh to be walking around in warm Los Angeles in my Lululemons. </p>\n<h2>On my 2020 reading list</h2>\n<h3>Non Fiction</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45186565-uncanny-valley?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=i791ozeuRM&#x26;rank=1\">Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener</a> - midway through this one. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545759.Man_s_Search_for_Ultimate_Meaning?ac=1&#x26;from_search=true&#x26;qid=B6sL98MeqR&#x26;rank=2\">Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E.
