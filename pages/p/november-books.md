## The books and my thoughts

Another month, another book review! Sorry that this one is late! :( I spent way too much time baking cookies, but that is another post!

**[The Chiffon Trenches: A Memoir by André Leon Talley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53499947-the-chiffon-trenches)**

I was excited to get my hands on a physical copy of this book. So I patiently waited for my library copy to be available. This book does a phenomenal job at peeling away the layers of the fashion industry and more specifically Anna Wintour's personal relationships with those around her. 

I will be honest, that after reading the controversies surrounding the treatment that the people of color at Conde Nast were receiving I was hoping that this book would redeem Anna Wintour in some way. However, it further entrenched in me the idea that the arbitrer of style and fashion is yet another white woman looking to promote and support people who look and think just like her. 

**[A Burning by Megha Majumdar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46250106-a-burning)**

I can't for the life of me remember how I came across this book. It's a beautiful story of three connected characters who are each trying to escape poverty and rise to the middle class. It's a predictable story, one of corruption, incompetence and heart. It's one I would recommend to those on a holiday. Great read for by the fire or the pool!

**[Home body by Rupi Kaur](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49656780-home-body)**

Too many folded down pages. Pretty please read for yourself. 

**[Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows)**

Ok, I will be honest, I judged this book way too early. I was around 10% in and I wanted to give up as the story was developing too slowly and I am not a big fan of science fiction anyway. However, I am grateful that I am unable to abandon a book, because that really saved this one. I am a complete convert! I was incredibly invested in each character, even the supporting ones by the end of the book and can't wait for the next one to be available on Libby! This might be the best science fiction I have ever read! Sorry Margaret Atwood!

I also love the introduction to the book on Goodreads, as it makes it sound like a Bollywood TV show;

```
A convict with a thirst for revenge

A sharpshooter who can’t walk away from a wager

A runaway with a privileged past

A spy known as the Wraith

A Heartrender using her magic to survive the slums

A thief with a gift for unlikely escapes
```
*insert dramatic music*

### 2020 reading list
