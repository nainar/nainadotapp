## What is it?
My love for Nandos knows no bounds. Remember my attempt at recreating the [Nandos chicken burgers](/peri-chicken.md) at home? Well I have been at hard at work for the past 2 years trying to recreate the Nandos Pakistan chocolate malt cake at home. This is the result of those 2 years worth of hard work. Enjoy!
