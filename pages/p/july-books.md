## The books and my thoughts

**[The 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23878688-the-5-love-languages)**

I had heard references to this in multiple podcasts I had heard, so I thought I would pick it up. While this version of the book targets couples trying to understand how to show affection to the other, the author has written equivalent books for the following as well:
- [Singles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615389.The_Five_Love_Languages_for_Singles)
- [Teenagers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49117.The_Five_Love_Languages_of_Teenagers)
- [Children](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/952.The_Five_Love_Languages_of_Children) 
- [Workplace interactions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11259079-the-five-languages-of-appreciation-in-the-workplace)
- [How to apologize in a relationship](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107515.The_Five_Languages_of_Apology)

I did realize that my love languages are words of affirmation and physical touch. No wonder quarantine has been stressful!

I would like to add a 6th love language though. Food. People express love through food, yes it is an act of service to cook for someone else. But there is a physical response to eating food that is worth exploring. Upcoming blog idea maybe? ðŸ¤”

**[Me and White Supremacy: Combat Racism, Change the World, and Become a Good Ancestor by Layla F. Saad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46002342-me-and-white-supremacy)**

Continuing on my efforts to acquaint myself with the racism in USA and be a better antiracist, I picked up Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad. This book isn't one you consume passively as an audio book. It is a journalizing exercise, there are probing questions to answers, thoughts to sit with.  

While the book was targeted at helping the reader come to terms with their white supremacy it was nonetheless useful as it made me come to terms with the way Asians have bought into the trope of being a model minority. I wasn't able to do one exercise a day as the book suggested as I had borrowed it from an e-Library, so I did sometimes do multiple exercises a day. I wonder if there is a companion guide for people of color who aren't black?

**[Sex and Vanity by Kevin Kwan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52064314-sex-and-vanity)**

I hadn't read a nice light rom-com recently (please ignore my sojourn into the Shopaholic series) and who better to cheer for than the humble, simple yet oh so glamorous Lucy. Kevin Kwan has a way of making you root for all the characters in his stories even if you hate them. They are lovable, hilarious and vivid! What else could you possibly want? This book is a nod to [A Room with a View by E.M. Forster](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3087.A_Room_with_a_View) and while I haven't read the original I do look forward to it now that I have read Kevin Kwan's hilarious take on it. Naina Raisinghani(Sunshine Montessori/ Karachi Grammar School/ Lahore University of Management Sciences) is intrigued!

**CURRENTLY READING [Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545759.Man_s_Search_for_Ultimate_Meaning?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=B6sL98MeqR&rank=2)**

This book showed up in my recommendations after I read The Tattooist of Auschwitz by Heather Morris. Lale and Viktor were both prisoners at the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. I am about 20% in and it's strange how while the author does speak to the desensitization that happens at these camps, I as a reader will still audibly gasp every time I read about the events that transpired at Auschwitz-Birkenau!

## Looking for recommendations

Earlier this month I shared my [reading goals](/reading-goals.md) from here on, so inline with that I am looking for recommendations in the following areas:
- Poetry
- Urdu fiction - please note I haven't read Urdu in 11 years, so any recommendations should be geared towards absolute beginners. 
- Audiobooks - I am going to start running again and am looking for audiobook recommendations to listen to while I run.
