It should come as no shock to anyone that I have chosen to use this time in quarantine to organize my life!

As someone who only had to worry about feeding herself on weekends, being responsible to feed myself 3 meals, 7 days a weeks + snacks is an all new responsibility I haven't experienced in ~5 years. 

`<Reader pauses to shake their head at the spoilt life of a tech worker.>`

I am embarrassing cooking, baking in the way I do anything else, by making lists! More specifically a meal prep planner. 

When creating a meal prep planner, I wanted it to have the following traits:
- A place to write the snacks for the day so that I could make sure I was consuming produce that would go bad.
- Be able to create the weekly grocery list as I was creating a meal prep planner to save time. 
- Have the planner start on the weekend (Saturday specifically) as that is when I do my meal prep.
- Be easily extensible to include a fortnightly meal prep. This was necessary as I am trying to limit my grocery trips in this time of social isolation.

So here goes, you can view my meal plan [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z0HIzC8i90GckV1KPP3rEysUzHgM1veF/view?usp=sharing) and make a copy for yourselves by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KpfGdN0aDWleNdtp7aUbs5hTrD1YDk4oO2FiFJF5AE/copy).
