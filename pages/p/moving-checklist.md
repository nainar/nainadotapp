title: "My moving checklist"
date: "2020-07-03"

It has now been roughly 4 months since I moved into my current place and I still vividly remember being stressed out the entire time. I was worried that I had forgotten something. That I wouldn't have internet when I moved or that my mail would still be getting delivered to my old address. So for future reference here are all the things I needed to check of my move list. 

The list is broken down chronologically:

Note: This is only useful for a local move (within a city or region). Also I was a single person moving a 1 bedroom house.

## 1 month before
- Start collecting boxes that you will be using to pack everything in or go to your closest Home Depot to buy the boxes you will need. 
- Start packing if you know this will take time. While packing, make sure to label the boxes with the following information:
  - What room that box should go in
  - Label each box with a number 1/n, 2/n, 3/n, etc to make it easier to account for at the other end. 

## 2 weeks before
- Keep/start packing
- Schedule installation appointments for the following:
  - Internet services - specially if you're moving in peak season, schedule this appointment sooner rather than later. Also allows you to put in the research if you want to switch providers.
  - Electricity services
  - Gas services (if separate from above.)
- Start researching movers - get some recommendations from friends, call up the ones with the best reviews in your area. Take the time to decide on your top pick.
- Start researching cleaners for your current apartment - get some recommendations from the landlord or friends, call up the ones with the best reviews in your area. Take the time to decide on your top pick.

  - Take a look at elevator access (if the movers will need to use it). Also make sure the elevator is covered in moving sheets if your building does provide it.

  - Any installation appointments

## Day off
