## The books and my thoughts

**[Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=6OXEgJUaT7&rank=13)**

A biologist writes fiction? I'm in! 

Even if you didn't know that Delia Owens was a biologist her descriptions of the marshes of North Carolina are a giveaway of her expertise. "Where the Crawdads Sing" give you an immediate role model in Catherine 'Kya' Clark - a strong girl, having to 'Home Alone' it in a shack. This is currently the best fiction I have read in 2020. 

**[Trick Mirror by Jia Tolentino](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=m9MoBmPkDA&rank=1)**

This book consists of essays written by Jia Tolentino - a writer for the New Yorker. My favourite was `The Story of a Generation in Seven Scams`, a holistic overview at some of the most well known scammers in US contemporary history. I found Jia's reflections on fictional heroines as written in `Pure Heroines` the most difficult to comprehend - potentially due to not having read much of the literature she quotes. It did give me along reading list to peruse later. It's definitely something I have bookmarked to reread later.  

**[Shopaholic to the Stars by Sophie Kinsella](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21064599-shopaholic-to-the-stars?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=A3zIhmToEu&rank=1)**

What can I say? Quarantine tricked me into thinking that reading Young adult romantic comedies would be be a good idea. The last time I read about Becky Bloomwood's shopaholic antics I was in my teens. Ten years (ðŸ˜²) later, I can confirm that my empathy doesn't stretch to finding her adventures amusing. 

But ahh to be walking around in warm Los Angeles in my Lululemons.
