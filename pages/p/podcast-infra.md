I started a podcast, just in case you missed the news!

It's called "The Nano Bookcast" and you can find the public page on Anchor: https://anchor.fm/naina-raisinghani.

Since I started my podcast, the most frequent questions I have been asked are around the infrastructure I have to record said podcast. It's not that difficult, so here it goes!

## Equipment
- I use the [Blue Yeti mic](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/) with a pop filter connected to it to record. 
- I use a Macbook Pro as my laptop of choice. 

## Recording, Hosting, Editing
- I use [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/) to do the following:
  - Host my RSS feed and audio recordings
  - Edit my podcast
  - Provide me with additional transition music
  - BONUS: It also helped me create a logo for my podcast!

## Uploading
Anchor automatically deals with uploading my podcast to a few platforms including Spotify. However, I had to manually add my podcast to Google Podcast Manager where it took a few days for the first episode to appear!

You can also manually claim your podcast on Spotify allowing you to get Spotify specific analytics. 

I will keep updating this article as my setup gets more complicated, for example when I have guests but this simple setup suffices for now!
