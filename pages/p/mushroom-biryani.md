## Notes
- I use [Shan's Sindhi Biryani powder](https://www.shanfoodsshop.com/product-category/recipe-mix/biryani-masala/). While I get mine on my annual trip to Pakistan, it is also available on Amazon if needed. However, [here](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/homemade-biryani-masala-powder/) is an alternative if you want to make Biryani powder at home.
