Guess how I started off my Independence long weekend? With a barbecue! Of course! Since this was the first time that I barbecued food, I thought I would write down everything I found useful, for the sake of posterity. 

## The menu
Since we are in the midst of COVID, this was a small group of people. We ate the following:
- Chicken skewers
- Paneer skewers
- Grilled corn
- Naan
- Fruit salad

We also drank mimosas - cause we're posh like that! :P

The meat (faux and chicken) were marinated **(Important: the night before)** in the [Shan Chicken Tikka masala](https://www.shanfoods.com/product/recipe-mixes/bbq/chicken-tikka/)

## The grill

The most difficult part of the day was actually turning on the grill. I had just moved to the building and wasn't acquainted with the grill at hand. Note to self, take the time to get to know the grill you will be using before said BBQ party. 

We used a gas grill that needed to be turned on from two different locations. Also grill take time to heat up.

- Oil
- Pastry brush (to spread said oil on the things you were grilling)
- Alumunium foil
- Water for cleaning
- Knife
- A few compost bags
- A bag to carry the dirty supplies back home
- Compostable plates
- Compostable cutlery
- Compostable bowls
