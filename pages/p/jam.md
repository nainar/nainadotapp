## What is it?
A framework to make jam

Makes: 1.5 cups of jam

## Ingredients
1. 1 pound fresh (or frozen, thawed) fruit. Ideas:
  - Berries
  - Apples
  - Peach/nectarine/stone fruit
1. Sweetening agent
  - Sugar (less than 1 cup)
  - Honey (less than 1/2 cup). I would use honey if you are using high quality fruit. 
1. 1 large Granny Smith apple (Don't need an extra apple if you are making apple jam)
1. 1 tbsp lemon juice
1. Something you want to consume said jam with (bread, english muffins, ice cream)

## Directions
1. If your fruit is large cut it up into 1/2 inch pieces
1. Grate your granny smith apple
1. Combine fruit and sweetener in a large heavy skillet. 
1. Stir in grated Granny Smith apple. 
1. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring and breaking up fruit, until sweetener dissolves. 
1. Simmer until jam is thickened, 10â€“15 minutes. 
1. Take off heat when you can make a line through the jam and the jam doesn't fill up the line immediately.
1. Stir in lemon juice.
1. Transfer to a bowl or jar; let cool. 
1. Cover and chill until set, about 2 hours.
