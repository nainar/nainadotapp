## The books and my thoughts

Ahh September, the first time I got on a place since COVID started dominating our lives. Here is what I read! There is more fiction, which I am happy about. 

**[Well-Behaved Indian Women by Saumya Dave](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53025774-well-behaved-indian-women)**

I remember seeing this book on someone's Instagram Stories and the title appealed to me. I have a soft spot for an intergenerational story and this one delivers. It talks of three women and their stories as they battle with society's expectations of a well behaved desi woman and the women they want to be. 

I wasn't a big fan of the ending as it seems like the author was too eager to tie everything up with a neat bow. It tries to tell us a story of compassion and growth, however you see limited growth from the protagonist Simran. 

However, I think this story has good representation of Indian cultures and traditions, of the rules that society unknowingly puts upon you, and the utter gravity to be that perfect women. A good holiday read. Why not follow this up with `Indian Matchmaking` on Netflix - your Indian culture primer kit.  

**[Midnight Sun by Stephenie Meyer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53287484-midnight-sun)**

I have no comments. It became available on Libby just as I was going on holiday. I knew it would be a bad. But come on, possessive, broody, unattainable vampire? The 16 year old in me still has a crush for Edward Cullen. 

Please don't judge me. 

**[The Circle Game by Margaret Atwood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/600318.The_Circle_Game)**

My second poetry anthology on my journey to read more poetry in 2020. I didn't realize that Margaret Atwood also wrote poetry, till I polled my Instagram followers for poetry I should be reading. 

[Spoilers] It took me a while, but I realized that the book itself is named after the children's rhyme `Ring a Ring o' Roses`. Reading poetry, specially that of Margaret Atwood's makes me wish I was back in my 9th grade Literature class, where our teacher helped us identify tropes and re-reading key lines, unravelling the story behind them. Being able to understand poetry may take time, however, I am willing to put in the effort. 

**[Obsessed: Building a Brand People Love from Day One by Emily Heyward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49231951-obsessed)**

Emily Heyward's brand Red Antler has worked with some of the most iconic startups of the past decade, such as Casper, Allbirds, Brandless and Prose. These are brands that I always come across on my Instagram. This book talks about the importance of aligning brand, product, user and company. I read the book for the case studies and it didn't disappoint.
