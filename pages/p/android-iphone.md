Cat's out of the bag. I got an iPhone. Well I sold a kidney and then bought an iPhone! This blog is going to be my living journal on how I feel about the iPhone.

## Expectations
But first let's talk about what expectations I had going in:
- A phenomenal camera
- A fast phone
- That I wouldn't be able to leverage the ecosystem benefits that folks keep touting as the number one reason to get an iPhone. The only Apple product I now own is the iPhone. I am convinced that folks who talk about this benefit  are just suffering Stockholm Syndrome from having spent so much money inthe ecosystem :P
- Being able to test out a lot of new cool products like Clubhouse.

## First week impressions
It has now officially been one week since I have owned an iPhone so here are some initial thoughts. 
- The fact that I could get a cute non boring iPhone case from the Apple website is definitely a win. I guess this is the ecosystem benefit that folks keep talking about. There isn't a large variety of 3P accessories on the Google Store.
- Setup was PAINFUL! While my account and contacts easily ported ovver to the new phone thanks to the `move to iOS` app, I had to manually install all apps that I needed. 
- Learning how to use the iPhone isn't as intuitive as folks claim it is. I am a relatively technically savvy person and my most common search query is still `How do I do X on the iPhone`?
- The camera is beautiful! I switched from a Pixel 4XL to the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the difference (specially in night mode) is incredibly stark. 
- I am thoroughly enjoying using Clubhouse which was the app that pushed me over the edge into getting an iPhone. 
- Since I am already a Google One customer, I don't see myself switching to iCloud anytime soon. 

## Coming soon: First month impressions
Here are some questions I am noting in advance that I want myself to think about answering:
- Am I using a lot of new apps that warrant the purchase of the iPhone?
- Am I tempted to buy any other Apple gadget or accessory?
- Am I still searching to try answer `How do I do X on the iPhone`?
