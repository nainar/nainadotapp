A few months ago, I talked about the sustainable practices I was committing to in 2020, however I missed out a large part of my daily life - reading. I read roughly 40 books a year and buying physical 40 physical books a year isn't sustainable for me in terms of the space they occupy in my expensive Bay area apartment or in terms of the paper required. So here is how I read sustainably, please note that this is what works for me:

## Practicing the principles I preach

1. The default option is to read e-books:
    - I have a library card with the Mountain View Public Library and the San Francisco Public Library. I use them to borrow e-books from the following apps:
      - [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/)
      - [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/)
    - Note: I own the [Kindle Paperwhite](https://amzn.to/37gE9P1) which I carry everywhere. Yes, everywhere. 
1. Only buy a physical book, if it is a book I imagine myself going back to often. E.g. here are cookbooks, poetry anthologies, books I ready annually example [As The Crow Flies by Jeffrey Archer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7201.As_the_Crow_Flies)
1. Copies of books should be purchased from independent booksellers, below are ones I have visited in person and online:
    - Cookbooks: [Omnivore Books](https://omnivorebooks.myshopify.com/)
    - San Francisco: 
      - [Borderland Books](https://borderlands-books.com/v2/index.html)
    - USA:
      - [Strand Bookstore](https://www.strandbooks.com/)
      - [Books Are Magic](https://www.booksaremagic.net/)
      - [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/pages/about) 
    - Note: There are SO MANY more independent bookstores, I would suggest looking around to find an independent bookstore selling the book you are looking for before looking to purchasing from Amazon. 
1. Borrow physical books from the library if I need to read a physical copy of a book. This could be for books with images or interactive elements. 
1. Allow myself to buy physical books when traveling. 
1. If I do buy a physical book that I have read and don't see myself re-reading, I look to donate to the nearest library. For example, [Friends of the San Francisco Public Library](https://www.friendssfpl.org/donatebooks.html) is accepting donations in COVID times as well. 

## Room for improvement 

This obviously leaves room for improvement, so please let me know if you have feedback. In addition here are somethings I am looking to improve on in the future:

1. E-books I buy are again funding Amazon, is there a way to read e-books while still helping out independent book sellers?
1. I currently have a Kindle, which I love. However, I am open to exploring other e-book readers when this one meets it's maker.  
1. Invest in 2 bookmarks that are made with 100% recycled material and can be recycled 100%. Currently, I use library receipts or dog ear the page to remember my place. *shudder*
