## Notes
- Sandwich maker: I have a Cuisinart sandwich maker. This [one](https://amzn.to/313Gcmk) to be precise. 
- If you don't own a sandwich maker, you can use a frying pan, instead. 
  - Add butter to the bread slices and sandwich the potato mixture in between. 
  - Use a flat spatula or a heavy heat proof object to flatten the sandwich. 
  - Flip the sandwich when the bottom turns golden brown.
