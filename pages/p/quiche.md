## What is it?
A vegetarian quiche recipe adapted from the NYT Cooking [guide](https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/29-how-to-make-quiche) on how to make quiche.

Serves: 4

## Ingredients
1. Crust:
  - 2 cups/250 grams all-purpose flour, more as needed
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - ¼ teaspoon sugar
  - 1 cup/225 grams unsalted butter (2 sticks), cold, cut in 1/2-inch cubes
  - 1/2 cup ice water, or as needed
1. Filling:
  - 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
  - 250g mushrooms
  - 250g spinach
  - 250g thinly sliced onions
  - 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
  - 2 large eggs
  - ⅔ cup heavy cream
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
  - 2 ounces Gruyère/soft cheese, shredded (about 1/2 cup)


## Directions
1. In a food processor, pulse flour, salt and sugar to combine. 
1. Add butter, then pulse until lima-bean-size pieces form. 
1. Gradually drizzle water into mixture and pulse just to combine, adding more water by the tablespoon if dough doesn’t come together. 
1. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Press it together into a ball, flatten into a disk and wrap in plastic. 
1. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days. (If you don’t have a food processor, see Tip below.)
1. While dough chills, cook the onions for the filling. In a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons butter and oil. 
1. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent.
1. Add mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are soft. 
1. Turn off the heat and stir in spinach.
1. Stir in flour and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
1. Butter a 9-inch tart pan. 
1. Take chilled dough out of plastic wrap and place on a floured surface. 
1. Roll dough into an 11-inch circle, drape it over tart pan and press into bottom edges and down sides. 
1. Use a knife or rolling pin to cut off excess dough, then use your fingers to push dough 1/4-inch up past the edge of the pan. 
1. Use a fork to poke evenly spaced holes in the bottom and sides of the dough and chill for 30 minutes.
1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. 
1. Place chilled tart on a baking sheet. 
1. Line with foil, fill with pie weights and bake for 15 minutes. 
1. Remove tart from oven and carefully remove foil and pie weights. 
1. Return tart to oven to continue baking, uncovered, until dough is just baked through and barely turning golden on the edges, about 5 minutes. 
1. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees.
1. In a large bowl, whisk to combine eggs, cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg. 
1. Fold in mushroom mixture, then half the Gruyère. 
1. Cube remaining 1 tablespoon butter into pea-size pieces.
1. Scrape egg and mushroom mixture into shell, smoothing top, and then scatter remaining Gruyère on top. 
1. Dot with butter pieces, then bake in a 375-degree oven until puffed and browned, 25 to 30 minutes. 
1. Let cool slightly, then remove tart ring from pan and slide quiche onto a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.


## Tip:
1. To prepare the dough without a food processor, use a pastry cutter or a knife and fork to cut butter into flour mixture. 
1. Stir in water until dough just comes together into a ball. 
1. Cut dough into 4 pieces, and use the heel of your hand to smear one piece away from you on the work surface so it spreads about 6 inches. 
1. Gather that piece, place it to the side and repeat with remaining pieces of dough. 
1. Press to combine all the smeared pieces into a flat disk, wrap in plastic and chill.
