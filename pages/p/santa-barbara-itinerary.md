I planned my first solo road trip to Santa Barbara in the middle of a pandemic, and here is my itinerary!

**Note: Things I researched but didn't end up doing are denoted with a `*` (asterisk)**

## General advice
- Make reservations for all activities and restaurants far in advance due to COVID capacity restrictions

## Accommodation
I stayed at the [Ritz Carlton Bacara, Santa Barbara](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/california/santa-barbara). Currently all restaurants on site are open for outdoor dining!

## Activities
Since I planned this trip last minute in teh middle of a pandemic I stayed away from group activities that required reservations and instead opted to free style the trip, here is what I did end up doing:
- Yoga at the hotel or on the beach!
- Hanging out at the hotel pool

### Water

### Land
- Hikes near Santa Barbara - I ended up doing a short hike near the hotel, but I would recommend checking out some hikes in the area!
