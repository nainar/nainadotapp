## The books and my thoughts

Another month, another book review! 

**[Homie: Poems by Danez Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44094014-homie)**

Homie is special in it's own right due to the way the poet uses the space on the page creatively to convey the point of his poem. I would recommend reading a physical copy for that purpose, since the Kindle (or any other e-book reader) won't allow you to experience the physical layout well. 

I highlighted more than half the book, but I leave you with this: 
```
what‚Äôs a blacker tax than blackness? before my grandfather passed he showed me where he hid his money & his gun what cost more than being poor? my aunt can‚Äôt hold on to a dollar, a job, her mind how much the power ball this week? imma print my own money & be my own god & live forever in a green frame i was war
```

**[Sincerely, by F.S. Yousaf](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53052684-sincerely)**

I don't have much to say other than please go read this book! üôèüèΩ F.S. Yousaf's description of his love for his wife is so pure and moving. It brought me to tears on multiple occasions. While I originally read this as an e-book I am ordering a physical copy to add to my collection. Let me know if you want to borrow my copy, as I am happy to spread the love here. :)

**[The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half)**

I was excited to pick up this book after reading [`The Mothers`](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815371-the-mothers) by the same author in 2017!

I read this book knowing it would cover race and specifically how mixed race people are treated in society. I didn't expect this book to go explore the LGBTQ community and the intersectionality between race and gender. 

This multi-generational family saga keeps you turning pages not just to find out what happens ‚Äî or how it happened ‚Äî but to find out more about who these people are. You hate and root for Bennett's characters simultaneously. It's a lovely holiday read if anyone is looking to pick one up.

**[The Girl in the Road by Monica Byrne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18297954-the-girl-in-the-road)**

This is my second science fiction this year after [The Testaments by Margaret Atwood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42975172-the-testaments?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=LwpQqZfw5R&rank=1). A friend recommended it to me, and I was excited that one of the protagonists was Indian! While I started reading the book for the science fiction, I stayed to answer the burning question, `What do these 2 characters have in common?` The answer was unexpected. Would definitely recommend reading.
