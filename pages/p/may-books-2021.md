## The books and my thoughts

Remember my forward looking apology from May? Yes! I still haven't gotten a sense of time :P 
However belated I may be here I am keeping with my monthly tradition, here are my reviews on the books I have read in May!

**[Northern Spy by Flynn Berry](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57650174-northern-spy)**

The book covers the IRA after the Good Friday Agreement. It is a story of the contemporary IRA and the impact the Troubles have on a young woman battling with being a good sister and a good single mother, in a deeply divided society. I think it’s definitely worth a read even if you don’t know much about the history of Ireland. I didn’t when I read this book and have since learned a lot about this topic.

**[What Tech Calls Thinking: An Inquiry Into the Intellectual Bedrock of Silicon Valley by Adrian Daub](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50403471-what-tech-calls-thinking)**

This wasn't the book for me. It talks about the philosophic ideologies that Silicon Valley is based on. My key takeaway from this book was that the ideologies that Silicon Valley touts as the basis of it's innovation are often, simply old ideas playing dress-up in a Patagonia vest. This doesn't shock me. Philosophy nerds might enjoy this book, but it wasn't my cup of tea, or my glass of La Croix :P

**[The Secret Life of Groceries by Benjamin Lorr ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50548165-the-secret-life-of-groceries)**

I mentioned earlier that my goal is to read more in the health space, and this book is health-adjacent? It's an expose that lays bare how grocery stores operate in America? The fresh fish that Whole Foods claims is ethicaly source? Yeah nah!

The author's immersive reporting makes this an incredibly engaging read that helps readers understand the human costs assocaited with the food industry. It's a must read for Americans wanting to understand how their food gets to them!
## My 2021 reading goals?

- Continue to read more poetry!
- Read more about the space of health, be it nutrition, mental health, physical health, etc.
- _Try_ to get into audio books. I don't think I will but it's worth a shot. I strongly believe that listening to audio books is useless as you don't capture or understand the content fully. 
- Continue reading books by diverse authors. 
- See my wider reading goals [here](/reading-goals.md).
