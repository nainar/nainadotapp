## The books and my thoughts

Books, books, books, books. I won't lie, my reading load was a bit lighter in March as I was planning on moving to DC!

However belated I may be here I am keeping with my monthly tradition, here are my reviews on the books I have read in March!

**[The Bride Test by Helen Hoang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39338454-the-bride-test)**

This book was in the "If you like Kevin Kwan you will love this list", so of course I had to read it! It's about the romance between Khai, an autistic Vietnamese-American and Esme, the woman his mother flies over from Vietnam for him to marry. 

It's a lovely beach read where you learn how Khai's autism doesn't allow him to realise or express his affection for Esme and costs him her affection. Just like any good inter generational family drama, this book has a few twists. For example, will Esme like Khai's charismatic brother? 
I would recommend reading this book on holiday!

**[The Prosperity Paradox by Clayton Christensen](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/37868583)**

This book came recommended by the [Li Jin ](https://twitter.com/ljin18) in her class [`The Creator Economy`](https://creatoreconomycourse.com/).

The book talks about how some of the world's efforts in dealing with global poverty have failed and highlights the common reasons for those failures. It then lays out a framework that the author thinks is worth following to be successful in solving these large problems. This is a great book for those interested in systems thinking and I am excited to read the author's other books such as `The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma` and`How Will You Measure Your Life`.

**[Bel Canto by Ann Patchett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto)**

I had heard gerat things about Ann Patchett's other book - [`The Dutch House`](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44318414-the-dutch-house) so I thought I would pick this up. 
In 1995, the president of Peru and many of his guests were taken hostage and held for months. Bel Canto is a fictitious story based loosely on those events. I didn't get along with this book immensely since I don't enjoy opera that much, it was an average read for me. 


## My 2021 reading goals?

- Continue to read more poetry!
- Read more about the space of health, be it nutrition, mental health, physical health, etc.
- _Try_ to get into audio books. I don't think I will but it's worth a shot. I strongly believe that listening to audio books is useless as you don't capture or understand the content fully. 
- Continue reading books by diverse authors. 
- See my wider reading goals [here](/reading-goals.md).
