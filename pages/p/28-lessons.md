On the 2nd of Janury 2021 after a long hike, I started scribbling down thoughts about the past year. It turned into a list of 28 things I learned last year. For no reason other than posterity here it is!
Am I already unlearning some of these lessons? Yes. Do I have thoughts after I have written them down? Hell yes! But I am writing them down for posterity here. 

1. It's important to know when to let go of your plans. 
1. It's ok to do nothing all day.
1. It's ok to do everything all in one day.
1. Find ways to celebrate even if those moments don't look like they did before
1. All it takes is practice.
1. I can control my reaction to events, even if I can't control the events.
1. I am a home body who loves her friends.
1. My love language (both giving and receiving) is physical touch.
1. I love the ritual of dining out.
1. I love the ritual of cooking my friends a lovely meal.
1. I am definitely not an audio books person.
1. I like eggplant? Sorry mom!
1. Oat milk >>> whole milk. Fight me. 
1. I will never master french patisserie. This might change. I hope?
1. Yes, I under salt things. It's a problem?
1. There is no such thing as one size fits all in life.
1. Having people virtually in your home for 8 hours a day can be tiring. 
1. It's ok to miss people you haven't had contact with in years.

1. It's ok that others got married, had kids, bought homes this year and I didn't.
1. Being a single 29 year old brown woman will be harder than a single 28 year old brown woman. I already knew this - but it just rings harder every year. 
1. It isn't too late to learn anything! Hello driver's license!
