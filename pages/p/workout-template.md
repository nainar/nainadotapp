I am going to say something that will probably jinx me forever. I have lost weight in shelter in place. I have been snacking less and drinking less carbonated soda. But most importantly I have been working out. I started doing Barry's online and then added some yoga into my schedule.

However, I have now developed a consistent schedule where I focus on one area of the body per day and have built in rest days. 

So here goes, you can view my workout regimen template [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRQPP-vTbm3qYX8iHp7nC2qmL-NBHyBB/view?usp=sharing) and make a copy for yourselves by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yeZH-k_8hQb3M-CI8najE4Km9y_zS32PtMKOUYYz00Q/copy).

And here are some instructions on how to customize the template:
- Pick a focus each day:
  - Body part, 
  - Type of exercise
  - Rest
- On days that you are working out, split up the workout into the following sections:
  - Warm up
  - Main workout
  - Cool down
- For each section list out the activities you want to take on.
